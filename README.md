This repository contains tasks that pertain to the custom implementation of the printf funcction found in the stdio.h library of C language. It is a joint project developed by Effiong Ekpe and Muhammad Abubakar, all of Cohort 9.

The printf function will handle the following coversion specifiers:
c
s
%
d
i
u
o

r
and length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers
Example:
_printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.\n");
_printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
_printf("String:[%s]\n", "I am a string !");
